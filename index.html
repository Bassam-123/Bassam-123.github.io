        <div class="project">
            <h3>Mitigation of Backdoor Poisoning Attacks in Deep Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>Implemented a backdoor attack mitigation system using DBSCAN clustering to identify potential poisoned data samples containing patch triggers in the CIFAR-10 dataset. Applied heatmaps to visualize the spatial distribution of these malicious points, efficiently localizing trigger positions; implemented inpainting techniques to fill the trigger. Reduced the overall attack accuracy by 90% by re-training the model.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Activity Volume Predictions in Twitter</h3>
            <p>Developed multiple regression models, including linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression, for predicting the number of active discussions on Twitter. Analyzed using different metrics like R² Score, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, and cross-validation scores. Observed that lasso regression is the best model as its generalization was better than other models, achieving an R² Score of 0.92.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Seoul Bike Rental Prediction</h3>
            <p>Conducted a comprehensive data regression analysis to develop a predictive model for Seoul Bike Rentals by utilizing 12 months of historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and timestamps to understand usage patterns. Applied XGBRegressor with 1500 gradient-boosted trees and a 0.01 learning rate. Created a model predicting the required number of bikes for rental with an R² Score of 0.91.</p>
